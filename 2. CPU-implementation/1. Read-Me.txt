CPU implementation has 4 main functions:
- calculate atom match matrix: atomMatchhingCPU.cpp 
- calculate similarity score: calculateSimilarityCPU.cpp
- sort the top k results: SortCPU.cpp
- Combined algorithm and simple command-line function: CPU-impelementation.cpp


To run the program
1. Run CPU-implementation,out or CPU-implementation,exe
2. Copy the mol file that you want to test into this folder  

Note: To recompile the program, use CPU-Implementation-Windows.bat or CPU-Implementation-Linux.bat as references
