GPU implementation has 4 main functions:
- calculate atom match matrix: AtomMatchhing.cu 
- calculate similarity score: calculateSimilarity.cu
- sort the top k results: Sort.cu
- Combined algorithm and simple command-line function: GPU-impelementation.cpp


To run the program
1. Run GPU-Implementation.out or GPU-Implementation.exe
2. Copy the mol file that you want to test into this folder  

Note: To recompile the program, use GPU-Implementation-Windows.bat or GPU-Implementation-Linux.bat as references
